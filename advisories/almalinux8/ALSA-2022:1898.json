  "details": "Fapolicyd (File Access Policy Daemon) implements application whitelisting to decide file access rights. Applications that are known via a reputation source are allowed access while unknown applications are not. The daemon makes use of the kernel's fanotify interface to determine file access rights.\nThe following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: fapolicyd (1.1). (BZ#1939379)\nSecurity Fix(es):\n* fapolicyd: fapolicyd wrongly prepares ld.so path (CVE-2022-1117)\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\nAdditional Changes:\nFor detailed information on changes in this release, see the AlmaLinux Release Notes linked from the References section.",
