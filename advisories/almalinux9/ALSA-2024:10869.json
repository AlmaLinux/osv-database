  "details": "Redis is an advanced key-value store. It is often referred to as a data-structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets. For performance, Redis works with an in-memory data set. You can persist it either by dumping the data set to disk every once in a while, or by appending each command to a log.  \n\nSecurity Fix(es):  \n\n  * redis: Redis SORT_RO may bypass ACL configuration (CVE-2023-41053)\n  * redis: possible bypass of Unix socket permissions on startup (CVE-2023-45145)\n  * redis: Denial-of-service due to malformed ACL selectors in Redis (CVE-2024-31227)\n  * redis: Lua library commands may lead to stack overflow and RCE in Redis (CVE-2024-31449)\n  * redis: Denial-of-service due to unbounded pattern matching in Redis (CVE-2024-31228)\n\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\n",
