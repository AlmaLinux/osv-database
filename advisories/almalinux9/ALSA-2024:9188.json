  "details": "BPFtrace is a high-level tracing language for Linux enhanced Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) available in recent Linux kernels (4.x). BPFtrace uses LLVM as a backend to compile scripts to BPF-bytecode and makes use of BCC for interacting with the Linux BPF system, as well as existing Linux tracing capabilities: kernel dynamic tracing (kprobes), user-level dynamic tracing (uprobes), and tracepoints. The BPFtrace language is inspired by awk and C, and predecessor tracers such as DTrace and SystemTap  \n\nSecurity Fix(es):  \n\n  * bpftrace: unprivileged users can force loading of compromised linux headers (CVE-2024-2313)\n\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.  \n\nAdditional Changes:  \n\nFor detailed information on changes in this release, see the AlmaLinux Release Notes linked from the References section.\n",
