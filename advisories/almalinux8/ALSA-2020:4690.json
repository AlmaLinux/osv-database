  "details": "Qt is a software toolkit for developing applications. The qt5-base packages contain base tools for string, xml, and network handling in Qt. \n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* qt: XML entity expansion vulnerability (CVE-2015-9541)\n\n* qt5-qtwebsockets: websocket implementation allows only limited size for frames and messages therefore attacker can cause DOS (CVE-2018-21035)\n\n* qt: files placed by attacker can influence the working directory and lead to malicious code execution (CVE-2020-0569)\n\n* qt: files placed by attacker can influence the working directory and lead to malicious code execution (CVE-2020-0570)\n\n* qt5: incorrectly calls SSL_shutdown() in OpenSSL mid-handshake causing denial of service in TLS applications (CVE-2020-13962)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\n\nAdditional Changes:\n\nFor detailed information on changes in this release, see the AlmaLinux Release Notes linked from the References section.",
