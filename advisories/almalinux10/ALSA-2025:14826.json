  "details": "PostgreSQL is an advanced Object-Relational database management system (DBMS). The base postgresql package contains the client programs that you'll need to access a PostgreSQL DBMS server, as well as HTML documentation for the whole system. These client programs can be located on the same machine as the PostgreSQL server, or on a remote machine that accesses a PostgreSQL server over a network connection. The PostgreSQL server can be found in the postgresql-server sub-package.  \n\nSecurity Fix(es):  \n\n  * postgresql: PostgreSQL executes arbitrary code in restore operation (CVE-2025-8715)\n  * postgresql: PostgreSQL code execution in restore operation (CVE-2025-8714)\n\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\n",
