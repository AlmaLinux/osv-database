  "details": "Redis is an advanced key-value store. It is often referred to as a data-structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets. For performance, Redis works with an in-memory data set. You can persist it either by dumping the data set to disk every once in a while, or by appending each command to a log.  \n\nSecurity Fix(es):  \n\n  * redis: Lua library commands may lead to integer overflow and potential RCE (CVE-2025-46817)\n  * Redis: Redis: Authenticated users can execute LUA scripts as a different user (CVE-2025-46818)\n  * Redis: Redis is vulnerable to DoS via specially crafted LUA scripts (CVE-2025-46819)\n  * Redis: Redis Lua Use-After-Free may lead to remote code execution (CVE-2025-49844)\n\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\n",
