  "details": "The rsync utility enables the users to copy and synchronize files locally or across a network. Synchronization with rsync is fast because rsync only sends the differences in files over the network instead of sending whole files. The rsync utility is also used as a mirroring tool.  \n\nSecurity Fix(es):  \n\n  * rsync: Path traversal vulnerability in rsync (CVE-2024-12087)\n  * rsync: --safe-links option bypass leads to path traversal (CVE-2024-12088)\n  * rsync: Race Condition in rsync Handling Symbolic Links (CVE-2024-12747)\n\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.  \n\nAdditional Changes:  \n\nFor detailed information on changes in this release, see the AlmaLinuxRelease Notes linked from the References section.\n",
