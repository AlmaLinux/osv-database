  "details": "gevent is a coroutine-based Python networking library that uses greenlet to provide a high-level synchronous API on top of libevent event loop. Features include: * convenient API around greenlets * familiar synchronization primitives (gevent.event, gevent.queue) * socket module that cooperates * WSGI server on top of libevent-http * DNS requests done through libevent-dns * monkey patching utility to get pure Python modules to cooperate  \n\nSecurity Fix(es):  \n\n  * python-gevent: privilege escalation via a crafted script to the WSGIServer component (CVE-2023-41419)\n\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\n",
