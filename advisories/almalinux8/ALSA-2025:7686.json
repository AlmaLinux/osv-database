  "details": "Redis is an advanced key-value store. It is often referred to as a data-structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets. For performance, Redis works with an in-memory data set. You can persist it either by dumping the data set to disk every once in a while, or by appending each command to a log.  \n\nSecurity Fix(es):  \n\n  * redis: Redis DoS Vulnerability due to unlimited growth of output buffers abused by unauthenticated client (CVE-2025-21605)\n\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\n",
