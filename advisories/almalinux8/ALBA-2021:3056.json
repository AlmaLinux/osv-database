  "details": "The nfs-utils packages provide a daemon for the kernel Network File System\n(NFS) server and related tools, which provides better performance than the\ntraditional Linux NFS server used by most users. These packages also\ncontain the mount.nfs, umount.nfs, and showmount programs.\n\nBug Fix(es) and Enhancement(s):\n\n* AlmaLinux 8.4 fails to obey sloppy mount option. (BZ#1982340)",
