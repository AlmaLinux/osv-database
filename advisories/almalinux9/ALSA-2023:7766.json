  "details": "The Container Network Interface (CNI) project consists of a specification and libraries for writing plug-ins for configuring network interfaces in Linux containers, along with a number of supported plug-ins. CNI concerns itself only with network connectivity of containers and removing allocated resources when the container is deleted. \n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* golang: crypto/tls: slow verification of certificate chains containing large RSA keys (CVE-2023-29409)\n* golang: html/template: improper handling of HTML-like comments within script contexts (CVE-2023-39318)\n* golang: html/template: improper handling of special tags within script contexts (CVE-2023-39319)\n* golang: crypto/tls: panic when processing post-handshake message on QUIC connections (CVE-2023-39321)\n* golang: crypto/tls: lack of a limit on buffered post-handshake (CVE-2023-39322)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.",
