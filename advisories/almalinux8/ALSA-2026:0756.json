  "details": "The transfig utility creates a makefile which translates FIG (created by xfig) or PIC figures into a specified LaTeX graphics language (for example, PostScript(TM)). Transfig is used to create TeX documents which are portable (i.e., they can be printed in a wide variety of environments). Install transfig if you need a utility for translating FIG or PIC figures into certain graphics languages.  \n\nSecurity Fix(es):  \n\n  * xfig: xfig: Stack-overflow allows possible code execution via local input manipulation (CVE-2025-46397)\n\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\n",
