  "details": "Redis is an advanced key-value store. It is often referred to as a data-structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets. For performance, Redis works with an in-memory data set. You can persist it either by dumping the data set to disk every once in a while, or by appending each command to a log.  \n\nSecurity Fix(es):  \n\n  * redis: Redis' Lua library commands may lead to remote code execution (CVE-2024-46981)\n  * redis: Redis allows denial-of-service due to malformed ACL selectors (CVE-2024-51741)\n\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\n",
