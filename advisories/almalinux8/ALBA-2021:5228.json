  "details": "The System Security Services Daemon (SSSD) service provides a set of\ndaemons to manage access to remote directories and authentication\nmechanisms. It also provides the Name Service Switch (NSS) and the\nPluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) interfaces toward the system, and a\npluggable back-end system to connect to multiple different account sources.\n\nBug Fix(es) and Enhancement(s):\n\n* Lookup with fully-qualified name does not work with 'cache_first = True'\n(BZ#2013379)\n\n* autofs lookups for unknown mounts are delayed for 50s (BZ#2016923)\n\n* 2.5.x based SSSD adds more AD domains than it should based on the\nconfiguration file (not trusted and from a different forest) (BZ#2018440)\n\n* Make backtrace less \"chatty\" (avoid duplicate backtraces) (BZ#2021499)\n\n* pam responder does not call initgroups to refresh the user entry\n(BZ#2028828)",
