  "details": "Valkey is an advanced key-value store. It is often referred to as a data structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets and sorted sets. You can run atomic operations on these types, like appending to a string; incrementing the value in a hash; pushing to a list; computing set intersection, union and difference; or getting the member with highest ranking in a sorted set. In order to achieve its outstanding performance, Valkey works with an in-memory dataset. Depending on your use case, you can persist it either by dumping the dataset to disk every once in a while, or by appending each command to a log. Valkey also supports trivial-to-setup master-slave replication, with very fast non-blocking first synchronization, auto-reconnection on net split and so forth. Other features include Transactions, Pub/Sub, Lua scripting, Keys with a limited time-to-live, and configuration settings to make Valkey behave like a cache. You can use Valkey from most programming languages also.  \n\nSecurity Fix(es):  \n\n  * redis: Lua library commands may lead to integer overflow and potential RCE (CVE-2025-46817)\n  * Redis: Redis: Authenticated users can execute LUA scripts as a different user (CVE-2025-46818)\n  * Redis: Redis is vulnerable to DoS via specially crafted LUA scripts (CVE-2025-46819)\n  * Redis: Redis Lua Use-After-Free may lead to remote code execution (CVE-2025-49844)\n\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\n",
