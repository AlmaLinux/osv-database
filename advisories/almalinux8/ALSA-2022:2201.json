  "details": "The rsync utility enables the users to copy and synchronize files locally or across a network. Synchronization with rsync is fast because rsync only sends the differences in files over the network instead of sending whole files. The rsync utility is also used as a mirroring tool.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* zlib: A flaw found in zlib when compressing (not decompressing) certain inputs (CVE-2018-25032)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.",
