  "details": "The gnutls packages provide the GNU Transport Layer Security (GnuTLS) library, which implements cryptographic algorithms and protocols such as SSL, TLS, and DTLS.\n\nNettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in almost any context: In crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages, such as C++, Python, or Pike, in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel space.\n\nThe following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: gnutls (3.7.6), nettle (3.8).\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* gnutls: Double free during gnutls_pkcs7_verify. (CVE-2022-2509)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\n\nBug Fix(es):\n\n* [IBM 9.1] [P10] POWER10 performance enhancements for cryptography: nettle - incremental work (BZ#2102589)\n* Allow enabling KTLS in AlmaLinux 9.1 (BZ#2108532)\n* DES-CBC bag is decryptable under FIPS (BZ#2115314)\n* allow signature verification using RSA keys <2k in FIPS mode (BZ#2119770)",
